# solarcat

This project will be a solar powered website made to catalogue sustainable material for the Ricker Library at UIUC. Throughout the past spring 2025 semester, I was able to complete the beginning phases of its implementation- such as preliminary research on how to make this project possible, creating a proposal to assemble it, designing the site, and coding it. While I was unable to fully complete my other goals that would finalize its implementation, such as building the server and mounting the solar panel, cataloguing featured items, or hosting the completed site on the server, I plan on achieving that when I come back from break.

Documents on my planning and design process can be found here:
